You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion.  Choose a door, a window, or an area within range  that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell  ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger  creature touches or enters the warded area. When  you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that  won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the  alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your  mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area.  This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand  bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. #### Alter Self*2nd-level transmutation*<ul style="list-style-type:none">

</ul>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,  choose one of the following options, the effects of  which last for the duration of the spell. While the  spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to  gain the benefits of a different one.

**Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an  aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing  webbing between your fingers. You can breathe  underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to  your walking speed.

**Change Appearance.** You transform your  appearance. You decide what you look like, including  your height, weight, facial features, sound of your  voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing  characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear  as a member of another race, though none of your  statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature  of a different size than you, and your basic shape  stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this  spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your  action to change your appearance in this way again.

**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines,  horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice.  Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning,  piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the  natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient  with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural  weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the  attack and damage rolls you make using it.
